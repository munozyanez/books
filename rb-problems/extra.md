# Morphology assessment


![](figures/problema8.png)

The robot in the figure is actuated by a motor-encoder-reducer assembly. The motor is AC type, whose maximum torque is 1 [Nm], and the maximum speed is 10,000 [rpm]. The gear is a Harmonic Drive type with a reduction ratio of 150:1 and efficiency of 90%. The encoder has 100 lines. The distance between the motor shaft and the end of the robot $l$ is 1 [m].

  * a) Calculate the maximum weight $Q$ that the robot can hold in its end effector.
  * b) Calculate the linear resolution of the movement in the robot's end effector in [mm].
  * c) If the motor runs at maximum velocity, what is the join angular velocity in [deg/s]?
  * d) Find a new encoder for a resolution of 0.01 [mm] in the end effector.
